Items for f405longskinny board layout
09/02/2018

1.  TE Connectivity connector outline
    Either turn off silkscreen outlines or
    Revise connector so it doesn't extend board

2.  Mount holes
    CAN bus end may need space, i.e. lengthen board

3.  Names layers silkscreen
    Position names associated with parts

4.  Revise LM2596 dc-dc footpring
    Make part to handle the two module sizes

5.  CAN bus connector
    Current 2x5 has unused pins and shrouded header
      1x4 header with side strain relief holes?
      Lengthen board and have in/out DE9?
		Retain 2x5 and double up some pins?
      Subboard with DE9 and 2x5 for ribbon to bms board?
      
6.  PCB Dimension cleanup

7.  JIC pads on STM32
    Where space permits add pads for other uses.
    
8.  Review--

    a) STM32 power pins
       Review power pins and by-passing for
       f103,f405, and f446 options
    b) Current limits on 5->9v module and regulators

9.  SIP + SMD 5V-9V module types
    Allow for both footprints

10. Connector connection sequence
    
    1st half top, etc. rather than 1,2,3, etc.

11.  Attach point compensation
    Resistance of interconnects not equal.
    Calibration table?

12. Thermistors
    - wiring different from nodes
    - number allowed for
