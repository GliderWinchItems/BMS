1. U$8 - 8 pin CAN driver Tx/Rx reversed

The Tx & Rx connections to the 8 pin CAN driver are reversed.

The error is in the eagle footprint and is carried over from
earlier boards that were never tested.

The original mistake was the footprint for TI ISO-1050 8 pin
isolated CAN driver. The smd pads are longer and further apart
than those on the 8 pin TI ISO-1042 (and substitute part, 
ADM3050), which are SIOC 8 packages, but they will still reach
the longer, further apart, pads for the ISO-1050 that is on
this version of the pcb.

Cutting the traces and wiring jumpers is relatively easy as
the Tx and Rx traces from the processor to the 8 pin driver
have a pair of vias at each end. The traces can be cut and
jumpers can be soldered to the vias.

This footprint error is correct on the 'V3 pcb layout. That
layout eliminates the option of installing the disharge
resistors (in the three hole configuration) so that external 
FETs are not needed. 'V3 includes the option of using SMD 
discharge resistors instead of thru-hole types.

The 16 pin CAN driver connections are corrrect for the 'V0 and 'V1
versions of this board. The V3 version corrects the 8 pin error
and also eliminates 16 pin CAN driver option.
