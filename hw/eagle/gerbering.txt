Notes on generating Gerber files

www guide for generating Gerber files from eagle--

Gerber online viewer--

1. The output file appears to default into the directory of the original .brd file and not the .brd
filel current in.

2. Script for cleaning old gerber files


deh@ASUS:~/GliderWinchItems/BMS/hw/eagle/bmsbmsBQ$ cat clean-gerber
rm *.gpi
rm *.sts
rm *.stc
rm *.plc
rm *.sol
rm *.cmp
rm *.pls
rm *.drd
rm *.drl

3. Script for zipping gerber files

deh@ASUS:~/GliderWinchItems/BMS/hw/eagle/bmsbmsBQ$ cat zip-gerber
zip $1.zip $1.sts $1.stc $1.plc $1.sol $1.cmp $1.pls $1.drd $1.drl

.drl file likely not needed.

4. Don't forget bottom layer silk screen

- Click: Add
- Click: Layers 20, 22, 26
- Set extension on output file to .pls

BUT--you might not want layers 22 and 21 on as they will have the silk screen
show the outlines of the parts and with the density of smd parts that
clutters up the silk screen.
