  This corrects the pcb error for the relays being "upside down",
  discovered in the first (and probably only) batch of (five) boards.

  eagleNucleo is the directory with the boards in use.

2. Ribbon pin assignments revision

The ribbon assignments for eagleNucleo, and bmsbmsBQ, pcb layouts
was based on 16 cells. With the advent of the ADBMS1818 the assignments
were revised to accommodate the 18 cells. This revised assigement
was used for the layout of the bms14921 16 cell board.

To use the BMScable boards with the new ribbon assignments required
a wiring adapter that goes between the battery ribbon with the 18 cell
assignment and the BMScable board with the 16 cell assignment.

A sub-board was make to do this. See-- 

GliderWinchItems/BMS/hw/eagle/bmsadapt18_16

Regrettably a mistake in this board has the columns reversed. To 
utilize the sub-board a hack to swap pin 3 & 4 on the header that
plugs into the BMScable pcb was made. The rest of the wires
simply involve the mapping of the ADC measurements to the 
cell sequence. This was done in the STM32CubeMX assignments
of the ADC scan sequence.
