Hi Raimo,

Something doesn't look right in this sequence. For example, if you want to set REG1 to 3.3V, you should be writing this:

10 3E 90 00  (Enter CONFIG_UPDATE mode)

10 3E 37 92 01   (Write REG0 Config address 0x9237 with data of 0x01)

10 60 35 05   (checksum and length)

10 3E 36 92 0D  (Write REG1 Config address 0x9236 with data of 0xD)

10 60 2A 05   (checksum and length)37 95

10 3E 92 00 (Exit CONFIG_UPDATE mode)

Best regards,

Matt
